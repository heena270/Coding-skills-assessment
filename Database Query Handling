1. Retrieve the Top 5 Customers Who Have Purchased the Most Books (by Total Quantity) Over the Last Year:

SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, c.email, SUM(od.quantity) AS total_books_purchased
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.email
ORDER BY total_books_purchased DESC
LIMIT 5;

2. Calculate the Total Revenue Generated from Book Sales by Each Author:

SELECT b.author, SUM(od.quantity * b.price) AS total_revenue
FROM Books b
JOIN OrderDetails od ON b.book_id = od.book_id
JOIN Orders o ON od.order_id = o.order_id
GROUP BY b.author
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

3. Retrieve All Books That Have Been Ordered More Than 10 Times, Along with the Total Quantity Ordered for Each Book:

SELECT b.book_id, b.title, COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders, SUM(od.quantity) AS total_quantity_ordered
FROM Books b
JOIN OrderDetails od ON b.book_id = od.book_id
JOIN Orders o ON od.order_id = o.order_id
GROUP BY b.book_id, b.title
HAVING total_orders > 10
ORDER BY total_quantity_ordered DESC;
